# Progressive Infrastructure Delivery using Kargo and Argo CD

This repository contains the code for my talk at the CD Mini Summit 2024 in Vienna, Austria and my Lightning Talk at the
KubeCon NA 2024 in Salt Lake City, Utah.

### Abstract

Since the day Kargo was released, I have been exploring the idea of using it not only to deliver and promote
applications but also to deliver infrastructure through its progressive delivery capabilities. Using Kubernetes-based
tools like Crossplane or Pulumi, we can define infrastructure as code and deliver it progressively to our management
clusters and then promote this infrastructure through different stages without the need for extra CD script magic.

Let me show you how Kargo helps platform engineering streamline and automate the progressive rollout of infrastructure
changes to all stages. This talk will cover the basics of Kargo and how to use it with Infrastructure as Code tools.
